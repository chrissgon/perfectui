# Tailwind CSS

Combine Perfect UI components with Tailwind CSS utilities for a light, fast and customizable solution.

### Perfect UI + Tailwind CSS = ❤️

Perfect UI is a framework inspired by Tailwind CSS, focused on providing basic components to create elegant user interfaces that are light, fast and customizable.

Because of this the framework does not provide classes for layout, breakpoints, fonts, colors and so on.

We strongly recommend that Perfect UI is used with Tailwind CSS to provide a complete solution.
